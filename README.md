Skill Swap Platform

Overview
This project is a web application designed to create a community-driven marketplace for skills. The Skill Swap Platform allows users to trade their expertise with others in a barter-style system. Instead of money, the currency is knowledge and time. For example, a user proficient in Photoshop can offer their skills in exchange for learning Excel from another user.

The goal is to build a mini-application that connects people who want to learn and teach, fostering a collaborative community.

Core User Features
The platform will include the following features for users:

üë§ User Profile Management
Create and manage a personal profile with basic information (name, optional location, optional photo).

List the skills they are willing to offer to others.

List the skills they want to learn.

Set their availability (e.g., weekends, evenings) to coordinate swaps.

Control profile visibility by setting it to public or private.

üîç Skill Discovery & Search
Browse a directory of other users on the platform.

Search for specific skills (e.g., "Photoshop," "Guitar," "Public Speaking") to find potential swap partners.

üîÑ Swap Request System
Initiate a swap request with another user.

Receive, review, and accept or reject incoming swap offers.

A personal dashboard to view the status of all current and pending swap requests.

Ability to delete an unaccepted swap request.

‚≠ê Ratings & Feedback
Provide ratings and feedback for users after a skill swap is completed to build a trusted and reliable community.

üë®‚Äçüíº Administrator Role
The platform will have a dedicated admin role with the following capabilities:

Content Moderation: Review and reject inappropriate or spammy skill descriptions to maintain platform quality.

User Management: Block users who violate platform policies.

Platform Oversight: Monitor the status of pending, accepted, and cancelled swaps across the platform.

Announcements: Send platform-wide messages to all users regarding feature updates, downtime, or other alerts.

Reporting: Download reports on user activity, feedback logs, and overall swap statistics.
